       "1  Due to inconsistencies in the amount owed that I was told by M & T Bank and the amount that was reported to the credit reporting agencies, I was advised to write a good will letter in order to address the issue and request the negative entry be removed from my credit report all together. I had a vehicle that was stolen and it was declared a total loss by insurance company. The insurance company and the GAP insurancw companypaid the outstanding balance of the loan, but I was told by M & T Bank that there was still a balance due on the loan. In good faith, without having received any proof as to why there was still a balance, I made a partial payment towards the remaining debt. I then sent the goodwill letter still offering to pay the remainder of the debt, but in exchange for the removal of the negative entry on my credit report. At one point, in XXXX 2015, per my credit monitoring agency, it showed a delinquent balance of {$0.00}, but when I checked my credit report again on XXXX X...  \n",
       "2  In XX/XX/XXXX my wages that I earned at my job decreased by almost half, by XX/XX/XXXX I knew I was in trouble with my home loan. I began contacting WFB whom my home loan is with, for assitance and options. \\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX I began the Loan Modification process with Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork b...  \n",

       "4  XXXX was submitted XX/XX/XXXX. At the time I submitted this complaint, I had dealt with Rushmore Mortgage directly endeavoring to get them to stop the continuous daily calls I was receiving trying to collect on a mortgage for which I was not responsible due to bankruptcy. They denied having knowledge of the bankruptcy, even though I had spoken with them about it repeatedly and had written them repeatedly referencing the bankruptcy requesting them to cease the pursuit, they continued to do so. When they were unable to trick me into paying, force me into paying in retaliation they placed reported to my credit bureaus a past due mortgage amount that had been discharged in Federal Court. On XX/XX/XXXX Rushmore responded the referenced complaint indicating that they would remove the reporting from my bureau, yet it is still there now in XX/XX/XXXX.
